Well I never really understood the system
I always seemed to put the emphasis on wisdom
But all this logistical, I'm about the logical
But I love the fast lane to try the impossible
Now I hear "Hi, I'm fifteen
My Dad's got lots of cash
I wanna be famous and I want to be fast"
Well have a little pride in your craft
The future becomes the past
And then you're stuck with mediocre legacy
I guess all I'm trying to say
Is there's gotta be a way
To write creatively
And still get paid
But who am I to talk?
I guess I'll just shout
"Gimme cash, baby! I'm sell out!"

I just wanna make the music for people
Scream truth from the roof
And tear down the steeple
I want to be a Saint
I don't want to be a teacher
I wanna show them how
And not just tell them like a preacher
I want to change the face of social interaction
Truth is love and I call to action
So why can't I seem to get anyone's attention?
I think this dimension needs an intervention
And that would be me, Sleexy T
Have you heard of me?
No!
You said you really liked it
When you came to my show
Should've known
It's not about the guitar
You wanna see me act a fool
And be another rock star, damn
