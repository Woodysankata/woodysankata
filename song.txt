Well I never really understood the system
I always seemed to put the emphasis on wisdom
But all this logistical? I'm about the logical
But I love the fast lane to try the impossible
Now I hear "Hi, I'm fifteen
My Dad's got lots of cash
I wanna be famous and 
I want it to be fast"
Well have a little pride in your craft
The future becomes the past
And then you're stuck with a mediocre legacy
I guess all I'm trying to say
Is there's gotta be a way
To write a little more creatively
And still get paid
But who am I to talk?
I guess I'll just shout
"Gimme cash, baby! I'm sell out!
